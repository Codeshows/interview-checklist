A checklist for important questions to be prepared for internship/ placement interviews

<a href="checklist/README.md">View the checklist</a>

## Motivation
This checklist would be helpful for college students appearing in college interviews and would save them the time of going through every random link on the web.

## How it works
Student A, is preparing for interviews and finds a relevent resource. He adds his discovery to the **interview-checklist**, Student B opens the interview checklist and gets to understand the concept thus saving time. He finds another one and adds it to the checklist. Student A later opens the checklist to study the new concept. Thus, both save their time by helping each other.

So, everyone while you are preparing to appear in interviews, help others and take help from others to get better :)
